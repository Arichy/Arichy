### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working as a Frontend Engineer and live in Beijing.

I used to work at ByteDance from 2019.09 to 2022.05, at LinkedIn from 2022.06 to 2023.06.

I have 4 years of working experience now.

I'm interested in JavaScript, React, VSCode, etc. Rust, but very new to it.

Besides, travelling lover.
